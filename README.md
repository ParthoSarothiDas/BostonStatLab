Repository created as part of the IBM Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL

## Overview
This project explores the Boston Housing dataset using core statistical techniques to uncover relationships between urban features and housing prices. From hypothesis testing to regression modeling, it provides a structured approach to understanding how factors like proximity to the Charles River, industrial land use, and access to employment centers impact home values.

## Key Analyses
- **T-Test**: Comparing median home values for properties near the Charles River vs. others.
- **ANOVA**: Investigating differences in home values across housing age groups.
- **Pearson Correlation**: Measuring the relationship between NOX concentration and industrial acreage.
- **Linear Regression**: Assessing the impact of distance to employment centers on home prices.

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scipy, statsmodels)
- Statistical methods: T-test, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, OLS regression
